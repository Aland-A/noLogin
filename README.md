<h1>This is a simple web tool that let's you upload, retrieve, and send text data without creating an account or logging in, hence the name.
Before uploading any data, the user first needs to write down a key, which can be used to retrieve the data by another user.
I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the backend I have used Firebase, more specifically Firebase Realtime Database. </h1>
